Inspired by Plague Inc., Going Viral is a free, open-source simulation which lets you simulate a worldwide plague, propagated by airplanes. The simulation is established on a well known model â€” SIRD disease spread model, which gives accurate and detailed statistics of a spreading disease. For a plague to spread all over the world, there can be many ways. The most effective way for international, or intercontinental spread, however, is by airplanes. Therefore, we focus on airlines only to simplify the simulation and provide a clean view of the spreading plague. Combined with real life data, Going Viral can give you a brand new experience of plague simulating.
